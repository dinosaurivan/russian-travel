        <p class="intro__text">
          According to polls by VCIOM, 95% of Russians dream of traveling somewhere,
          but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their own country.
          They say, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact,
          Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south,
          dense forests of Sayan Mountains, and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau.
          Moreover, you can see all these beauties without millions in your bank account,
          a foreign passport, or long-haul flights. Like Vera Bashmakova - a brave young mother,
          who took her three children, put them in her "Lada" car, and drove 20,000 kilometers across her native country.
          We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

              It's a unique natural area on the edge of the Russian exclave.

              But the Kaliningrad Oblast doesn't end there.
              For the traveler and explorer, nearby is also the westernmost point of Russia,
              the Baltic Spit, and the German legacy of small coastal towns.
              The atmosphere of these places eliminates hustle and bustle,
              immersing you in the tranquility of nature and the scent of the cool, steel sea.

              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
              Primarily because of its mountains: if you travel along the ridges,
              you will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
              And if you open the windows of your car, you can experience
              the invisible wonder of the local air — mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="places__text">
              The climate in Altai is moderate, so it's best to visit in the summer.
              This way you can see the diversity of the local flora and fauna.
              Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles soar above the ridges,
              and deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls -
              also inhabitants of the Altai region.

              Baikal is known to everyone as the largest lake in the world.
              Many also know that it is the largest source of freshwater
              and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="places__text">
              But Baikal is also an ideal place for skijoring competitions.
              Skijoring is a sport where a skier is attached to a motorcycle,
              and the tandem tries to achieve the highest possible speed on the ice.
              In March 2019, at the "Baikal Mile" festival, a world record was set
              with a speed of 197.011 km/h.

              Siberia doesn't end at the Urals, it ends in Karelia:
              the Siberian larch, which forms the taiga, does not grow west
              of Lake Vodlozero. But here it grows up to 30 meters tall -
              the forests of Karelian national parks have never known an axe
              due to impassable swamps. Some pines here are over a thousand years old.
              Touch a living creature that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible did.
              In the virgin forest, you won't find a trail for hundreds of kilometers.
              And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters above the ground
              are marked with bear claws, so that everyone knows who's the master here.
